        The world famous Alexandria Library – a.k.a. Bibliotheca Alexandrina – is a massive cultural and scientific edifice, which attracts eager knowledge seekers within and outwith Egypt. It is another landmark of Alexandria, which plays an invaluable role in spreading cultural, civilizational and historical information along with a number of cultural centers spread around the city.
        Since its foundation by Alexander the Great, Alexandria has always been the meeting point of cultures and civilizations as evidently witnessed by the numerous museums, monuments and relics from the Pharaonic, Hellenic, Roman, Coptic and Islamic times.
        With its unique location overlooking the Mediterranean, its temperate weather and its attractive beaches, Alexandria has been an essential spot on the itinerary of tourists visiting Egypt. Therefore, it was pivotal to build a marina for yachts to promote yacht tourism industry, and hold local as well as international boat racing competitions, which further add to the city's appeal for tourists from around the world.
